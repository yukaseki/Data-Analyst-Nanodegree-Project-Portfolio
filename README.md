# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of projects made for the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program at Udacity

### Project 1 : Explore Weather Trends
> In this introductory project,  I have analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

### [Project 2 : Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/yukaseki/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Project_2_Investigate_a_Dataset)
> In the Part 2 of the course, I have learned the data analysis process of questioning, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Also, I have gained familiarity to work with data in Python using libraries like NumPy and Pandas. As my 2nd project, I have chosen a dataset to perform an investigation and share my findings.

### [Project 3 :  Analyze A/B Test Results](https://github.com/yukaseki/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Project_3_Analyze_AB_Test_Results)
> Throughout the Part 3 of the course, I have learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to important, real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models. As my 3rd project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to help a fictitious company to understand whether if they should implement a new page, or keep the old page based on my  A/B testing result.

### [Project 4 : Wrangle and Analyze Data](https://github.com/yukaseki/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Project_4_Wrangle_and_Analyze_Data)
> In the Part 4 of the course,  I have learned the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. And I have developed my skills to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for deeper analysis. As my 4th project, I have gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. Then, through analyses and visualizations, I have showcased my wrangling efforts.

### [Project 5 : Communicate Data Findings](https://github.com/yukaseki/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Project-Portfolio/tree/master/Project_5_Communicate_Data_Project)
> In the Part 5 of the course, I have learn to apply sound design and data visualization principles to the data analysis process in order to use analysis and visualizations to tell a story with data. As a final project, I have chosen a dataset and performed an exploratory data analysis using Python. Then, I have created a presentation with explanatory plots that conveys my findings.
